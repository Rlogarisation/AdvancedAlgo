In order to find the maximum number of files can be caught by the frog, which can only jump forward from i to i+3 or i+4 pad. The status of this question is position, which is the only factor is going to looped through. The frog has two choices on each lily pad, they are jump towards i+3 pad, or i+4 pad. Hence the maximum result can be generated by combining the status and choices. At the end, dp[pos] can be defined as maximum amount of files that can be caught by frog at current position. 

```java
int calculateMaxFiles(int[n] f) {
    return dp(int[n] f, 0);
}
int dp(int[n] f, int pos) {
    // Base case: End the loop if frog reaches end of lily pad.
    if (pos >= EndofLilyPad) {
        return 0;
    }
    // Two choices: jump to i+3 or i+4.
    for (int i = 3; i <= 4; i++) {
        int maxInNextPosition = dp(f, pos + i);
        // Select the max between what we got so far,
        // or future possible choices,
        // through depth first search.
        return Math.max(dp(f, pos), (maxInNextPosition + numOfFilesOnCurrentPad);
    }
}
```

Overall the time complexity to solve this question is O(n^2).
